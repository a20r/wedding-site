# Lareau Earth Hugo Theme

A custom Hugo theme built for an earth-toned Vermont wedding celebration. It powers the single-page site with a sticky scroll-spy navigation bar and sections for story, schedule, travel, lodging, registry, RSVP, and a mountain biking Easter egg.

## Features

- Sticky navigation with scroll-spy highlighting
- Responsive grid-based layout with earth-toned palette
- Configurable content via `hugo.toml` parameters
- Built-in MTB section for local ride recommendations

## Usage

Add `theme = "lareau-earth"` to your `hugo.toml` and structure site content using the parameters outlined in the repository README. The theme expects a single-page layout rendered from `layouts/index.html`.

## Customization

Update colors, typography, or imagery in `assets/css/main.css`. Sections and copy can be adapted directly within the layout or by extending the template with your own partials.
