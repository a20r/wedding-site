      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>From chance encounters on a frosty Vermont lift line to late-night campfire plans, our story has always been rooted in the mountains. We fell in love exploring winding singletrack, trading homemade maple lattes, and sharing the quiet rhythm of small town life. On July 11, 2026 we get to bring everyone we love to the heart of it all: Lareau Farm in Waitsfield.</p>
      <p>We're so grateful that you're making the trip to celebrate with us among green hills, big skies, and the scent of spruce after a summer rain.</p>
